# Cert Completer

Cert Completer is a small Kubernetes operator that ensures that all TLS secrets
have a valid `ca.crt`.

It addresses a specific issue with the (Let's Encrypt) ACME provider in
[cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager), where certificates
are lacking a CA in the `ca.crt` key of the generated secret. Although issues
have been raised to fill the `ca.crt`
(see [#2111](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues/2111) and
[#1571](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues/1571)), it is not clear
if and when these issues will be resolved. Cert Completer is an attempt to patch
this issue immediately regardless of the cert-manager version.

To provide each TLS secret with a `ca.crt`, the operator parses the certificate
chain in `tls.crt`. It uses the last (top-most) certificate in this chain for
`ca.crt`. Although this does not guarantee that `ca.crt` contains a root CA, it
does guarantee that the CA present is valid for the TLS secret.

## Installation

Using pre-built resources:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awsprof/cert-completer/master/cert-completer.yaml
```

Using Kustomize (requires kubectl > 1.15):

```bash
kubectl apply -k github.com/awsprof/cert-completer//config/default
```

Clone and modify
[./config/default/kustomization.yaml](./config/default/kustomization.yaml)
for alternative, custom deployments.
